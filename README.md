Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project that applies various machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes based on medical data. The primary goal of this project is to leverage different machine learning techniques to build robust models that can assist in early diabetes detection and provide insights into the data.

Algorithms Implemented
The following machine learning algorithms are utilized in this project:

Logistic Regression: A statistical model used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, leveraging the logistic function.
Decision Tree: A tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that assigns a class to an instance based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space.
Data Preprocessing
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the models, the following data preprocessing steps are performed:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset are imputed using the mean of the respective columns to ensure no loss of valuable data.
Feature Scaling: Standardization of the dataset is performed using StandardScaler to bring all features to the same scale, which is essential for algorithms like SVM and KNN.
Encoding the Target Variable: The target variable 'Outcome' is ensured to be categorical and properly encoded for model training.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various medical predictor variables and one target variable, 'Outcome', indicating the presence of diabetes. The predictor variables include:

Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
